# Scripts made to fully automate repetive tasks

Repetitive tasks is timeconsuming, so it will benefit us to automate these tasks to save us some time and pain.

I would like to share these automation that I have done for other to use, and to see if you can see any improvement that can be made.

## Linking up the certification - Letsencrypt
We have all been there, moving from one server from another and the certification need to be moved along. But LetsEncrypt need to have link it files to their folder `/etc/letsencrypt/live/`. So we linking them up, one by one. This automate it.

More to come..
